# Parkinson's Disease Study

This study is a personal work that investigates the functional connectivity of brains of cognitively normal patients, Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment, and Parkinson's disease patients with dementia. 
The aim of this study is to create a functional representation of the brains, compare the brains by sub-group to deterimine differences between sex, age, handedness, and years of education, and further infer what level of electrical stimulation at what specific location in diseased patients would allow for the return to healthy cognition. This project is a part of the edX MITx 6.419x Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications course. It implements data acquired from [OpenNeuro: Parkinson's disease, functional connectivity, and cognition](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004392/versions/1.0.0) and is cited below.

## Original Dataset Description
Title: Parkinson's disease, functional connectivity, and cognition.

This dataset contains patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, scanned with resting state fMRI, and who underwent a neurocognitive test battery. Included are cognitively normal patients, Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, and Parkinson's disease dementia.

## Project Rubric

     Clearly states a sociological question which is interesting and relevant to the data. The question must be sociologically motivated: for example, “Compare the network structure in 2003 vs 2009" is not a good question, without further context. If you have some reason to believe that the network structure changes in those years, then you should make that your central question: for example, “Did crimes involving youth offenders become more organized and structured over the years" is a better question, from which comparing the structure in different years becomes part of the methodology to answer the question. More examples of possible questions for cooffending networks are provided below.

        (2 points) Describes methodology for network analysis.

        (2 points) Grader is convinced that the methodology makes sense for the question to be answered. Grader is convinced that no additional methodology within the bounds of techniques taught and discussed in this module could be applied beyond what was described. The grader should only consider additional methodology that adds meaningfully to the answer for the question: additions that simply repeat or confirm the presented results should not be considered by the grader. If a justification is provided for why a particular method was not used, the grader should be convinced by that argument. 

        (2 points) Presents results, including figures and/or statistics, which address the question of interest.

        (2 points) The described methodology has been applied in complete and the results shown (that is, the author did not forget to include anything they discussed in the methodology.) 

    Adequately discusses the results obtained.

        (2 points) Question does not need to be successfully answered, but the grader should be convinced that the author has answered the question to the best ability of the methodology presented.

        (1 point) Provides commentary on what was discovered, what were the limitations of the methods, what may have been surprising to discover, etc.

        (1 point) Award this point if the question was successfully answered to the grader's satisfaction. 

## Hope for Future Use
I hope to leverage the understandings in this repository for further understandings of the human mind, to create a path toward practical implementation of a Neuralink device to provide care to real-world patients, and to augment these understandings for future applications.

## Process
- [x] Acquire data
- [ ] Process data
- [ ] Cluster data into healthy, MCI, and Dementia
- [ ] Segregate the data by handedness, sex, education, and age
- [ ] Create Visualizations
- [ ] Identify Stimulation Requirements
- [ ] Visualize the healthy version of a stimulated MCI or Demented cognitive patient
